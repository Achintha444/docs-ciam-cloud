# WSO2 Private CIAM Cloud - Overview

Today's companies work with a wide range of partners and suppliers to provide services and products to its markets. These business-to-business (B2B) relationships minimizes the costs for the companies and also improves efficiency and income. 

For this B2B model to work, partners, clients, suppliers, and other stakeholders are required to interact efficiently, securely, and conveniently at every stage of their business relationship. In B2B, customer identity and access management (CIAM) is just as important as it has been for more traditional B2C models. 

The WSO2 Private CIAM Cloud (built on WSO2 Identity Server) for B2B allows businesses to manage their relationship with other businesses transparently.
